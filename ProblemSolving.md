Here are some top problem-solving interview questions involving arrays that are commonly asked by top tech companies like Google, TikTok, and others:

### 1. **Two Sum**
- **Problem**: Given an array of integers and a target sum, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
  Output: [0, 1]
  ```

### 2. **Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)**
- **Problem**: Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
  Output: 6
  ```

### 3. **Merge Intervals**
- **Problem**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  ```

### 4. **Product of Array Except Self**
- **Problem**: Given an array nums, return an array such that each element at index i is the product of all the numbers in the original array except nums[i].
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
  Output: [24,12,8,6]
  ```

### 5. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**
- **Problem**: Given a sorted array that is rotated at some pivot, search for a target value.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
  Output: 4
  ```

### 6. **Find the Duplicate Number**
- **Problem**: Given an array of n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
  Output: 2
  ```

### 7. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
- **Problem**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
  Output: 4
  ```

### 8. **Trapping Rain Water**
- **Problem**: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
  Output: 6
  ```

### 9. **Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**
- **Problem**: Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
  Output: 1
  ```

### 10. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**
- **Problem**: Given an array where the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i, find the maximum profit you can achieve.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  Output: 5
  ```

These questions test a candidate's ability to handle arrays, understand the underlying algorithms, and apply efficient solutions.
